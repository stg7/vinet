traceview
=========

Traceview is a small tool for visualisation of different traceroute calls.

The idea is based on a software project (Vitranet) that I built with 7 other peoples a long time ago during our
computer science study. Vitranet was just a small prototype, and no one published or maintained it for years, thats
why I created traceview.

Requirements
------------
You need:

* scons
* g++/c++ compiler and build tools
